# Soyon's Portfolio: A Vibe Coding Journey

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project represents more than just a showcase of my work—it is my first deep dive into **"Vibe Coding"**, powered by **Google Gemini** and the **Antigravity IDE**.

## 🚀 The Purpose & Journey

The goal of this project was to embrace a new way of building software: transforming raw intent into a polished reality through AI-assisted collaboration. My journey didn't start with code, but with a vision.

1.  **Ideation**: I started by outlining exactly what I needed—a professional, high-impact portfolio to showcase my Full Stack experience.
2.  **Design**: I materialized these ideas into a comprehensive **Technical Design Document**, defining the architecture, aesthetics, and user experience constraints.
3.  **Realization**: Working alongside **Antigravity** (powered by Gemini), we pair-programmed this application. We iterated on the "Cyberpunk/Developer" aesthetic, solved TypeScript errors, and implemented responsive layouts in real-time.

This repository serves as a testament to how modern AI tools can accelerate the transition from "Idea" to "Shipped Product" without compromising on technical depth or creativity.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This application is built with a modern, performance-focused stack:

*   **Core**: [React](https://react.dev/) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (Fast HMR and bundling)
*   **Styling**: [Material UI (MUI)](https://mui.com/) with a custom **Cyberpunk/Brutalist** theme.
*   **Font**: Inter (Headings) + Fira Code (Monospace elements).
*   **Deployment**: Azure Static Web Apps (Planned).
*   **AI Partner**: Google Gemini (Antigravity IDE).
